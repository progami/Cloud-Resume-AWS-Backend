Super helpful video series by open up to the cloud on the cloud resume challenge, this has some minor differences i.e. Go is used but provides a solid foundation

Following stack is followed in this implementation of the cloud resume challenge

- HTML, CSS, JS (Frontend)
- Python
- AWS Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK/Boto3 
- Route 53 (DNS)
- DynamoDB (Database tier)
- API Gateway / Lambda / AWS SAM (Backend)
- Cloudformation (IaC)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- GitHub (Source Control)
- Makefiles (Easier builds)

## This project relies heavily on AWS-SAM for most implementations, i suggest you go and look it up seperately
